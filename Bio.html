          McCurry was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and attended Penn State University. He originally planned to
          study cinematography and filmmaking, but instead gained a degree in theater arts and graduated in 1974. He
          became interested in photography when he started taking pictures for the Penn State newspaper The Daily
          Collegian.
          After a year working in India, McCurry traveled to northern Pakistan where he met two Afghans who told him
          about the war across the border in Afghanistan.
          McCurry's career was launched when, disguised in Afghani garb, he crossed the Pakistan border into
          rebel-controlled areas of Afghanistan just before the Soviet invasion."As soon as I crossed the border, I
          came across about 40 houses and a few schools that were just bombed out," he says. He left with rolls of film
          sewn into his turban and stuffed in his socks and underwear. These images were subsequently published by The
          New YorkTimes, Time and Paris Match and won him the Robert Capa Gold Medal for Best Photographic Reporting
          from Abroad. McCurry covered more armed conflicts like the Iran–Iraq War, Lebanon Civil War, the Cambodian
          Civil War, the
          Islamic insurgency in the Philippines, the Gulf War and the Afghan Civil War. There have been a couple of
          dangerous moments where McCurry came close to losing his life. He was almost drowned in India and he survived
          an airplane crash in Yugoslavia. McCurry has had his work featured in magazines worldwide and he is a frequent
          contributor to National Geographic. <img class="unoim" src="./immagini.home/steve-mccurry-3.jpg" width="400px"

          McCurry concentrates on the toll war takes on humans. He intends to show what war does to not only the
          landscape,but to the people who inhabit that land. "Most of my images are grounded in people. I look for the
          unguarded moment, the essential soul peeking out, experience etched on a person’s face. I try to convey what
          it is like to be that person, a person caught in a broader landscape, that you could call the human
          condition.What McCurry wants his viewers to take away from his photographs is the "human connection between
          all of
          us." He
          believes there is always some common thing between all humans despite the differences in religion, language,
          ethnicity,
          etc.
          McCurry also states, "I have found that I get completely consumed by the importance of the story I am telling,
          the feeling that the world has got to know. It's never about the adrenaline. It's about the story." However,
          sometimes McCurry has witnessed some "horrific" and "distressing" sights. In times like these, he uses his
          camera as a "shield" because it's easier to witness these events through a viewfinder.
